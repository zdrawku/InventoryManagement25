## Integration Points

### Backend API Endpoints Required
The frontend expects these endpoints (currently being implemented in backend):

1. **Authentication** (3 endpoints)
   - POST /api/auth/register
   - POST /api/auth/login
   - GET /api/auth/logout

2. **Equipment** (6 endpoints)
   - GET /api/equipment
   - GET /api/equipment/{id}
   - POST /api/equipment
   - PUT /api/equipment/{id}
   - PUT /api/equipment/{id}/status
   - DELETE /api/equipment/{id}

3. **Requests** (6 endpoints)
   - POST /api/request
   - GET /api/requests
   - GET /api/manager/requests
   - PUT /api/request/{id}/approve
   - PUT /api/request/{id}/reject
   - PUT /api/request/{id}/return

4. **Reports** (3 endpoints)
   - GET /api/reports/usage
   - GET /api/reports/history
   - GET /api/reports/export

## Testing Status

### Frontend Tests
- ✅ Build successful (no errors)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ Component structure validated
- ✅ Routing configuration verified
- ✅ Auth guards functioning

### What Works Now
- ✅ All UI pages load correctly
- ✅ Navigation between pages
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Equipment API (existing backend)

### Pending Backend Integration
- ⏳ Authentication endpoints
- ⏳ Request management endpoints
- ⏳ Report generation endpoints
